    <h3>The Power of Creation</h3>
    <p>As a wife and mother with a full-time career, living with depression is often extremely overwhelming. While there are many treatments, I still haven't found the one that actually works... so I do the best I can with what I've got.</p>

          <h4>Craft Therapy</h4>
          <h5>An Uncommon Approach</h5>
          <p>While it is becoming a more wide-spread practice, for some the act of creating things helps soothe the symptoms. My own personal experience is that the act of creating something (and being in control of the creation) is extremely beneficial.</p>

          <h4>Seykolova's Craft Stash</h4>
          <h5>Something To Consider</h5>
          <p>My partner is very supportive of my unconventional therapy but, as you might imagine, it created a surplus of handcrafted items in our home that did nothing but take up space. He suggested sellling some items at craft fairs. It seemed like a good idea, so Seykolova's pop-up shop was born.</p>

          <h4>The Art of Compromise</h4>
          <h5>Talking My Brain Into Proper Pricing</h5>
          <p>Many of my items are underpriced. I know this and am reminded of it often by friends and family. I'm still working on wrapping my head around charging people for my therapy. I found an app that helps price handmade items and have started using it. Hopefully that and learning a little about marketing will be a good combination.</p>

      <h2>And That Other Thing...</h2>
      <p>Depression is no joke. It's not a passing phase or somehting that will just fade away. If you feel like you need help, please seek it. If someone you love asks you if you're okay, don't hide behind the fake smiles.</p>
